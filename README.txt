Background:
The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) is a parcel delivery service in the Salt Lake City area.  The WGUPS needs to deliver an average of 40 packages daily in Salt Lake City, with WGU acting as the hub.  Some packages include additional restrictions, such as arriving to the hub late, or having requirements to be on the same truck as other packages.  Additionally, some packages have delivery deadlines in the middle of the day.  Three trucks and two drivers are available to deliver the packages.

Program Overview:
The purpose of this program is to determine an optimized route for the three trucks such that the packages can be delivered in less than 140 miles.  This program utilizes a greedy algorithm.  The package data is provided in an attached CSV file.  The addresses and distances between addresses are also provided.

Instructions:
In PyCharm, launch main.py.  The program will display the distance in which the packages were delivered.  Follow the prompts to display package status at a given time.
